My name is Adam.  I grew up in the vast desert of Washington State.  I still slightly resent the fact that I have to add the word "state" to that sentence for anyone to know what I'm talking about, but I love teaching them about the desert there so I still go around saying it.

Some of my favorite things are: having fun with my wife and pup, learning something new, sharing something I've learned, and anything made by Apple Inc.

I'm also into podcasts and fitness
